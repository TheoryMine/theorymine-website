Setting up the Argument Mapper
(on Ubuntu Linux)

1. Download/setup apache and postgresql:

From a terminal type:
---
sudo tasksel install lamp-server 
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5
sudo apt-get install php5-pgsql
---
(enter passwords, config, etc as appropriate/default)

More details at: 
http://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

This installs the so called "LAMP" (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) server
in Ubuntu, as well as the postgres SQL stff you need and appropriate php libraries. 


2. Download the this software (you've probably already done this if you are reading this):

From your preferred directory in which you want the argument mapper
software to live, typing in a terminal:
--- 
svn co https://kenyersel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kenyersel/trunk/anon anon
--- 

This will create a directory called "anon". 


3. Initialise superuser password for Postgres: 

if this is the first time you've setup postgres, you need to set the
super-user. Login to porgres as superuser from a shell with:

--- 
sudo -u postgres psql postgres
--- 

(You will probably be asked your super-user/root password)

3.2 change the postgres password to something secure by typing (at the
  prompt "postgres=# "):
---
ALTER USER postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '***A SAFE PASSWORD***';
\q
---


4. Make the SQL User and Database:

4.1. create a database user for accessing the database (replace
USERNAME with your created user name). This should be the same
username as your unix username in order to access your DB directly
with psql:

--- 
sudo -u postgres createuser -P -S -D -A -R USERNAME
sudo -u postgres dropuser -P -S -D -A -R USERNAME
---

and set the password for USERNAME when asked. It is the -P flag lets
you make up a new password for the SQL user. The password does not
matter too much if you are the only user of your machine.

4.2. create the database "kenyersel" which is owned by the user
   USERNAME, by typing the following in a terminal:

--- 
sudo -u postgres createdb -O USERNAME kenyersel 
sudo -u postgres dropdb kenyersel 
---


5. Make a symbolic link of to the argument mapper directory in your
   apache webspace, for example: 
---
ln -s kenyersel/trunk/anon /var/www/anon
---

Note that /var/www corresponds to your web-server. So, you can view
the argument maps by directing your browser to: 
http://localhost/argmaps2

6. Goto the webpages and finish the setup...
