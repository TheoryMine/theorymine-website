Deletion:

On deletion of a point, all relations of pro/con subpoints are deleted as well
but the arguments themselves still exist. This should be refined as all links
to access/find these arguments might dissapear as well, leaving zombie points.

1) Delete all arguments that have no in/out relations anymore
or
2) Interactively do this with a user to re-establish certain links
(probably unfeasable)
