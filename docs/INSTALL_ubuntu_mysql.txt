Setting up the Argument Mapper
(on Ubuntu Linux)

1. Download/setup apache and mysql:

From a terminal type:
--- 
sudo tasksel install lamp-server
--- 
(enter passwords, config, etc as appropriate/default)

More details at: 
http://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

This installed the so called "LAMP" (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) server
in Ubuntu


2. Download the argument mapper software:

From your preferred directory in which you want the argument mapper
software to live, typing in a terminal:
--- 
svn co https://kenyersel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kenyersel/ kenyersel
--- 

This will create a directory called "kenyersel". Inside this you will
find the "trunk" directory in which the latest version of the argument
mapper software is held, currently "argmaps2", i.e. the directory of
interest is:
--- 
kenyersel/trunk/argmaps2
--- 

3. Setup the SQL databases:

From a terminal, first login the to database server and create a
database for kenyersel:

1. Login to mysql program:
--- 
mysql -u root -p -h localhost
--- 

You will probably be asked your password. 

2. create the database "kenyersel" by typing the following at the
   "mysql>" prompt: 
--- 
CREATE DATABASE kenyersel;
--- 

3. create a special user to accessing the database locally from your
   webserver, by typing (I suggest you do it line-by-line): 
--- 
CREATE USER kys;
SET PASSWORD FOR 'kys'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('**PASSWORD**');
GRANT ALL ON kenyersel.* TO 'kys'@'localhost';
quit;
---

Make up a password for the SQL user "kys", and replace **PASSWORD**
above by your password. It doesn't matter too much if you are the only
user of your machine. 

4. Make a symbolic link of to the argument mapper directory in your
   apache webspace, for example: 
---
ln -s kenyersel/trunk/anon /var/www/anon
---

Note that /var/www corresponds to your web-server. So, you can view
the argument maps by directing your browser to: 
http://localhost/argmaps2
