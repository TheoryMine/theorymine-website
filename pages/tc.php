This may include, without limitation, requiring you to fax, email or otherwise send certain identification documents to us.

<li>We may review (or procure the review of) any information you submit through the Payment Website prior to collecting (or procuring the collection of) the Price using the Specified Payment Method.

<li>You undertake not to use your Specified Payment Method: 
    <ol type="1">
<li>in a manner that results in or may result in Chargebacks, or liability for us to pay any sums, including without limitation any fees or fines to any third party;

<li>to test credit card behaviour; or
<li>when you have a rating within any credit reporting agency indicating a high level of risk associated with your use of services the same or similar to the Specified Payment Method.

<li>We make no representation or warranty regarding the amount of time taken to complete transfer of the Price from the provider of your Specified Payment Method to us.
<li>You agree that we may satisfy any liability of you to us in full through use of your Specified Payment Method. 
<li>You consent to the providers of the Payment Website and your Specified Payment Website disclosing to us information concerning any payments made by you hereunder and details of your Specified Payment Method and our subsequent disclosure of this information in so far as may be necessary to enable us to properly and fully exercise our rights under these terms and conditions.
