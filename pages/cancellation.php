<h1><!--Cancellation Policy--><?print $thislang['canc_title'];?></h1>
<p>
<!--When you buy from TheoryMine your theorem is produced specifically for you. Therefore you can cancel at any time before production begins. All you have to do is email us on info@theorymine.co.uk and we will get your money refunded and order cancelled. If production has begun then unfortunately we cannot refund your order. If your order is not satisfactory (i.e.-theorem is not unique) then you can certainly let us know and have your theorem refunded.--><?print $thislang['canc_p'];?>
