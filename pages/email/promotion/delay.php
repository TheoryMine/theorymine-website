<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>
We are emailing you regarding your order with TheoryMine.
</p>
<p>
We've had a lot more orders than we expected and our robot mathematicians is taking a bit longer than anticipated to discover the theorems. We're writing to let you know that your theorem is likely to be a couple of days late.
</p>
<p>
However, we would like to reassure you that you will receive your theorem before Christmas (in particular we expect to send you your theorem before the 23nd of Dec).
</p>
<p>
We are really sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Please feel free to email us if you have any questions. We are doing all that we can to get your orders fulfilled as soon as possible. 
</p>


<p>
If you require any further information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:<? print $admin_email; ?>"><? print $admin_email; ?></a> 
or have a look at our <a href="<? print $url ?>/?go=faq">F.A.Q webpage</a>.
