<h2><!--About your purchase--><?print $thislang['faq_sec1'];?></h2>
<h3 class="para_heading" id = "what_buy"><?print $thislang['faq_q1'];?></h3>

<p><!--You can buy new theorems which become yours to name. You will receive a printable certificate in PDF form of the theorem and its discovery (including an outline of the proof). You can then give this away, frame it, sing it, as you like! </p><p>In the near future, there will be a range of products available to go with your theorem, like T-shirts, mouse mats and mugs. Don't worry if you would like your theorem before these extra products become available, you will be able to purchase the new products for your existing theorem as soon as they are available.--><?print $thislang['faq_a1'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="process"><?print $thislang['faq_q2'];?></h3>

<p><!--If you are not already registered with TheoryMine, you will receive a user name and password to log into the website where you will be able to view the status of your order. <br>
It will take a up to 2 working days (excluding weekends) for our robot mathematicians to discover your theorem.
You will receive a notification email once your theorem is discovered. You will then be able to download the certificate by logging into this website, and clicking &quot;View Certificate&quot;.--><?print $thislang['faq_a2'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="extras"><?print $thislang['faq_q3'];?></h3>

<h2><!--About how TheoryMine works--><?print $thislang['faq_sec2'];?></h2>


<h3 class="para_heading" id="what_theory"><?print $thislang['faq_q10'];?></h3>


<p><!--From school mathematics you will recall various kinds of numbers: whole numbers, fractions, decimals, etc. You may also have met sets or vectors. These are all examples of <a href="?go=certificate_example#data-type">mathematical objects</a>. The first thing that TheoryMine does is create new kinds of mathematical object and it can generate an unlimited number of these. In school mathematics you apply <a href="?go=certificate_example#functions">functions</a> to numbers, such as addition and subtraction. The second thing that TheoryMine does is create new kinds of functions on these new mathematical objects. TheoryMine can also generate an unlimited number of functions. A Theory is composed of one or more mathematical objects plus some functions on such mathematical objects.--><?print $thislang['faq_a10'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="what_theorem"><?print $thislang['faq_q11'];?></h3>

<p><!--A <a href="?go=certificate_example#theorem">theorem</a> is a mathematical formula for which we have a proof. Both theorems and proofs are within a theory which consists of a set of axioms. A proof is a sequence of formulae, starting with some axioms and ending with the theorem. Each non-axiom formula in this sequence follows from the previous formulae in the sequence. All the axioms in TheoryMine theories are recursive definitions.--><?print $thislang['faq_a11'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="what_rec"><?print $thislang['faq_q12'];?></h3>
<p><!--<a href="?go=certificate_example#recursion">Recursion</a> is a mathematical technique that is much used in computer programs. In a recursive definition, the value of a recursive function is defined in terms of values of the same function applied to smaller inputs. This sounds circular, but because the function's inputs get smaller and
  smaller the computation eventually stops. TheoryMine also uses recursion to define brand new types of input and output for each theory. These are called recursive objects.--><?print $thislang['faq_a12'];?></p>
<h3 class="para_heading" id="which_theorems"><?print $thislang['faq_q13'];?></h3>
<p><!--TheoryMine proves properties of functions. For instance, when it comes to addition, it does not matter in which order the numbers are added: 2+3 is equal to 3+2, whereas when it comes to subtraction it does: 2-3 is not equal to 3-2. TheoryMine might discover that some of its functions are like addition; giving equal answers whatever the order of the objects to which they are applied. Some functions are inverses of each other, e.g. addition and subtraction: adding a number and then subtracting it, brings you back to where you started. TheoryMine might also discover that some of its new functions are also inverses. The theorems discovered by TheoryMine typically take this simple form.--><?print $thislang['faq_a13'];?></p>

</p>
<h3 class="para_heading" id="proof_fine"><?print $thislang['faq_q14'];?></h3>

<p><!--The computer programs behind TheoryMine are large and complex and so, like all large complex programs, almost certainly contain bugs However, most of the program merely chooses theories and theorems to prove, and directs their proof. The construction of the proof is handled by a small, well
inspected and highly trusted kernel program that only combines axioms and
previously proved theorems. It is therefore vanishingly unlikely that any proof it
constructs would be faulty.--><?print $thislang['faq_a14'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="how_possible"><?print $thislang['faq_q15'];?></h3>

<p><!--TheoryMine is based on decades of world-class research into automated
reasoning and artificial intelligence at the Universities of Edinburgh,
Cambridge and Munich.  It uses the grammars of theories and theorems to generate candidates, filters out the obviously false and uninteresting ones, and then uses automated reasoning to see which of the remainder it can prove.--><?print $thislang['faq_a15'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading"id="original"><?print $thislang['faq_q16'];?></h3>

<p><!--The TheoryMine program constructs brand new mathematical theories, that no-one has previously developed by using brand new recursive functions and recursive objects. By definition, all theorems of these new theories are themselves brand new.--><?print $thislang['faq_a16'];?></p>


<h3 class="para_heading" id="trivial"><?print $thislang['faq_q17'];?></h3>

<p><!--There are two senses in which your theorem is not trivially true. Firstly, note that some mathematical theories are inconsistent i.e. the axioms contradict each other. In such theories all formulae are theorems, which is clearly
undesirable. However, it is a well-established mathematical result that theories consisting only of recursive definitions, as TheoryMine's theories are, are inherently consistent. So you can be sure that your theorem is not trivial in this sense. The second sense in which these theorems are not trivially true is that they cannot be directly derived by a simple calculation. In particular, they are not true by simple rewriting from other known theorems, as described in more detail in the answer to the question: <a href="#interesting">IS MY THEOREM INTERESTING?</a>.--><?print $thislang['faq_a17'];?></p>


<h3 class="para_heading" id="interesting"><?print $thislang['faq_q18'];?></h3>

<p><!--TheoryMine applies a series of filters to remove uninteresting theorems
before it generates them. On the other hand, don't expect your theorem to earn you the Fields Medal! (the Nobel Prize of Mathematics). In particular,
we use the notion of interesting initially developed in
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/bk711q2u247mr967">Conjecture Synthesis for Inductive Theories (Journal of Automated Reasoning)</a>
which was then further developed in
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m885557421m7418m">Scheme-Based Synthesis of Inductive Theories (LNCS, Volume 6437)</a>.
Technically, this ensures that standard orderings, using known theorems as rewrites, cannot prove the new theorem: that there is no direct symbolic calculational proof of the new theorem.--><?print $thislang['faq_a18'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading"id="authority"><?print $thislang['faq_q19'];?></h3>

<p><!--It is a long-standing tradition in mathematics that the author of a new
theorem has the authority to name it. TheoryMine assigns that authority to you.--><?print $thislang['faq_a19'];?></p>

<h3 class="para_heading" id="forever"><?print $thislang['faq_q20'];?></h3>

<p><!--A theorem, once proved, stays proved for ever. The reasoning in the proof is
deductive, so contains no element of probability or uncertainty. Theorems are abstract objects that are not subject to wear and tear. Even diamonds will be destroyed in the heat death of the universe; theorems won't be.--><?print $thislang['faq_a20'];?></p>
